# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA
Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is based on multivariate data analysis using projection methods.
PCA considers a Coordinate transformation (i.e. a rotation) from the arbitrary axes (or “features”) you started with to a set of axes ‘aligned with the data itself'.
The central idea of PCA is in reducing the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of interrelated variables while retaining variance of original dataset as much as possible.
